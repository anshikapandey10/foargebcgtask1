intend to solve your problem by the following steps:

Step 1: Test the hypothesis

The hypothesis can be tested by analysing the historical data about customers . Collect historical data about all customers' contracts

⚫ Extract data on the customers who transferred to other providers

' contracts.

Identify whether customers churn and an increase in price happened at the same time . Prove the hypothesis

If the customer churn is along with an increase in price, we can conclude the growth in prices affects customer churn. On the contrary, if customers transfer to another providers when there is no change

even a decrease in price, we can say prices do not affect customer churn.

Step 2: Build a model to predict customer churn It is a binary classification problem. All customers are labelled with either 1 (switch to another provider) (stay with the current provide). In order to build a powerful model to predict customer churn, I intend to

complete the following tasks:

⚫ Task 1: Collect data on all customers, including

⚫contract data: starting time and ending time, price, discount, promotions, etc

⚫customer information: name, country, city, profit, revenue, company size, industry, etc

energy usage: energy consumption amount If transfer to other providers, this is the target label

Task 2: Understand and clean the data

• Task 3: Exploratory data analysis

Discovering data patterns by data visualization

Task 4: Build a machine learning model and evaluate its performance Train a model on the clean dataset got in task 2

Use cross-validation to evaluate the model performance Task 5: Identify whether a discount on price can prevent customer churn

Apply 20% discount on the prices, then predict the customers' labels again. If the predicted labels (got i 4) change from 1 to 0, this indicates the discount can stop customer churn. On the contrary, if the predi labels are still 1, this indicates the discount cannot stop customer churn
